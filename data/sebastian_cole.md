# Sebastian Cole

## Profile
Tinkerer. Hacker. Handsome Rogue.  

I love technology. I want to use it to make cool things, that people love.  

Of all the different tech, I love the web. I love that it connects us all and is both amazingly simple, but amazingly complex. I get up in the morning to figure out how to make things work in the web.

 I dream about 100% uptime.  
I get excited by graph databases.  
I drool over highly available data centres.  

I am Smart, Courageous, Humble and I Give a Shit.
